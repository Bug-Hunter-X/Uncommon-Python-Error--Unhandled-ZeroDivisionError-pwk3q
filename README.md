# Uncommon Python Error: Unhandled ZeroDivisionError

This repository demonstrates a simple Python function that can raise a ZeroDivisionError if a specific condition is met (the input `a` is 0).

The `bug.py` file contains the faulty code, and the `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that handles the potential error using exception handling (try-except block).

This example highlights the importance of handling potential exceptions to prevent unexpected program crashes and enhance robustness.
